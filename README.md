## Overview
Bank Loan Predictor is a machine learning-based project designed to predict whether a customer is likely to be approved or denied a bank loan. This repository includes the machine learning model for loan prediction and a user-friendly frontend for interacting with the model.

## Demo
https://bank-loan-predictor-shaarangpd.streamlit.app/ (If applicable, provide a link to a live demo of your project)

## Dataset
The loan prediction model was trained on a dataset that includes customer information, credit history, and loan approval outcomes. You can find more information about and download the dataset from the following link:
